## Comparison of Pirate Modes

| Aspect | Classic Pirate Mode | Enhanced Pirate UI                                                                                                                                                               |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Description** | ‚úì Basic bookmarklet for simple text translation to pirate speak. | ‚úì Advanced bookmarklet with a floating control panel for interactive features.                                                                                                   |
| **Key Features** | ‚úì - Real-time translation<br>- Banner with reset<br>- Music toggle | ‚úì - All Classic features plus search, tooltips, settings persistence, and speech synthesis                                                                                       |
| **How It Works** | ‚úì Fetches and runs a lightweight JS script that translates text nodes, adds a banner, and handles music playback directly in the browser. | ‚úì Fetches and runs a more complex JS script that includes a floating UI, allowing users to search translations, adjust settings, and use voice synthesis for spoken pirate text. |
| **Intended Use** | ‚úì Ideal for quick, fun translations on any webpage with minimal overhead, suitable for users wanting simplicity. | ‚úì Designed for users seeking a richer experience with additional tools, like customizing translations or using voice features, making it more engaging for prolonged use.        |
| **Performance** | ‚úì Lightweight and fast, with low resource usage. | ‚úì Slightly heavier due to UI elements, but still efficient and client-side.                                                                                                      |
| **Accessibility** | ‚úì Basic support with ARIA labels for core elements. | ‚úì Enhanced accessibility, including full ARIA roles, settings for customization, and better support for screen readers.                                                          |
| **Speech Synthesis** | ‚úó Not available; text is only visually translated. | ‚úì Included, with options to hear translated text spoken in pirate voice using Web Speech API. **(Soon)**                                                                         |
| **Gold Flash Effect** | ‚úì Words flash gold briefly after translation. | ‚úì Inherited from Classic, with potential for more customization in the UI.                                                                                                       |

## Step-by-Step Usage Guide
1. **Add to Bookmarks**: Drag the 'üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Pirate Mode' button from the website to your bookmarks bar.
2. **Navigate**: Go to any webpage you want to translate.
3. **Activate**: Click the bookmark to transform the page into pirate speak.
4. **Reset**: To return to normal, click the 'Reset to normal' link in the banner that appears.

The bookmarklet is self-contained and client-side:
- It scans the webpage's text nodes and replaces words using an embedded dictionary.
- Excluded elements (e.g., inputs, buttons) are skipped to avoid breaking functionality.
- Translation can be toggled on/off with reversibility for a seamless experience.
- No external servers are used; everything runs in the browser for privacy and speed.
